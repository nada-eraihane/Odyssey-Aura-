# 🌍 Odyssey Aura – Travel Blog Website (First-Year Project)

This is my **first-ever website**, built during my first year as a computing student. The project is a **front-end only travel blog**, created to practice and showcase HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. While the website isn’t fully responsive, it focuses on functionality, design consistency, and learning key web development principles.

## ✨ Overview

**Odyssey Aura** is a multi-page travel blog that includes stories, tips, and destination highlights. It was designed to:

- Present content in a clear, structured way
- Experiment with layouts, styling, and basic interactivity
- Simulate a real-world travel blog experience

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Custom styling + hover effects)
- JavaScript (Simple search function)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- Google Fonts (`Lora`, `Ubuntu`)
