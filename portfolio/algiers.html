                <h2>Algiers</h2>
                <img src="images/algiers1.jpg" alt="Algiers">
                <p>Algiers, the capital city of Algeria, is a beautiful coastal gem where the Mediterranean breeze meets rich North African culture. Known as 'Alger la Blanche' (Algiers the White) for its stunning whitewashed buildings, the city offers a fascinating blend of French colonial architecture and Islamic heritage.</p>

                <p>I began my exploration in the historic Casbah — a UNESCO World Heritage site with narrow alleys, vibrant street life, and ancient homes perched on a hillside. The views of the sea from the top were absolutely breathtaking.</p>
                <img src="images/algiers2.jpg" alt="Algiers">

                <p>From there, I visited the Martyrs' Memorial, an iconic monument honoring those who fought for Algeria’s independence. The structure itself is massive and symbolic, and the surrounding gardens make it a peaceful place to reflect.</p>

                <p>One of my favorite experiences was wandering along the bustling streets of downtown Algiers, lined with cafés, bakeries, and markets. I tried *khobz el dar* (traditional Algerian bread) and *makroud*, a delicious date-filled pastry.</p>

                <p>I also took time to visit the Notre-Dame d’Afrique basilica. Perched on a cliff overlooking the bay, its architecture is incredible, and inside it holds messages of peace and unity in many languages.</p>

                <p>Algiers feels both timeless and dynamic. From ancient ruins to vibrant neighborhoods, it’s a city that invites you to slow down, explore, and listen to its stories. Whether you're watching the sunset over the harbor or chatting with locals in a teahouse, there’s a sense of warmth and welcome everywhere you go.</p>

                <p>Before I left, I spent one last afternoon walking along the seafront promenade, soaking in the sun and savoring the salty breeze. Algiers may not always be in the spotlight, but it has a quiet magic that lingers long after you’ve gone.</p>
